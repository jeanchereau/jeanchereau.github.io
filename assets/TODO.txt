Hey! How's it going? Thank you for visiting our website. We're Ghost of the Past, a bunch of friends who decided to create a band just to play a little rock'n'roll together. We eventually chose to take things to a higher level by making our own stuff. On this home page, you can listen and download our music for free with no constraints at all. We hope you enjoy what we've worked hard to create! Please feel free to give us any feedback or advice.
